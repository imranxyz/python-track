'''
1) Syntax error
* Spelling mistake
* Brackets / quotation mistake
* Statement properly not structured
print(Hi there') // Syntax errors
'''

'''
2) Indentation error
* An indentation error means something is wrong with the way
you’ve structured the code

if (True):
print('Hi') // indentation errors
'''

'''
3) Type errors
* A type error isn’t a typing error—it means your code has
mixed up one type of data with another, such as confusing
numbers with strings

print('budget'*'money') // type errors
'''

'''
4) Name errors
* A name error message appears if your code uses the name
of a variable or function that hasn’t yet been created. To
avoid this, always define your variables and functions
before you write code to use them

print(f'I live in {hometown}')
hometown = 'Moscow' // name errors
'''

'''
5) logic errors
* Sometimes you can tell something has gone wrong even
if Python hasn’t given you an error message, because your
program isn’t doing what you expected. It could be that
you’ve got a logic error. You may have typed in the code
correctly, but if you missed an important line or put the
instructions in the wrong order it won’t run properly.

print('Oh no! You've lost a life!')
print(lives)
lives = lives – 1
